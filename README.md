### **About Me**

I'm a passionate full stack developer who loves building scalable and maintainable web applications. I have a strong focus on writing clean, efficient, and reusable code with an eye for design and user experience. I enjoy diving deep into frontend and backend technologies, and constantly seek opportunities to learn, collaborate, and grow in the tech world.

I believe in the power of open source and actively contribute to projects that excite me. Whether it's crafting intuitive UIs, architecting RESTful APIs, or working with databases and cloud infrastructure, I'm always eager to get my hands dirty and solve real-world problems through code.
